The adequate acronym for the current edition (0.31, April 2017) is "CoNLL-Merge".
Together, CoNLL-Merge and CoNLL-RDF constitute the ACoLi CoNLL libraries. CoNLL-Merge allows to merge TSV files with concurrent annotations, CoNLL-RDF parses TSV files into annotation graphs and allows for their flexible transformation.

From these, the first describes the concept of CoNLL-Merge, the second describes the implementation as part of the ACoLi CoNLL libraries.
